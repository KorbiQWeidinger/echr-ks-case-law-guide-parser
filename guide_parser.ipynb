      "“The  High  Contracting  Parties  shall  secure  to  everyone  within  their  jurisdiction  the  rights  and \n",
      "freedoms defined in Section I of [the] Convention.” \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "High Contracting Party (1) – Responsibility of States (1) – Jurisdiction of States (1) \n",
      "\n",
      "1.  As  provided  by  Article  1,  the  engagement  undertaken  by  a  Contracting  State  is  confined  to \n",
      "“securing” (“reconnaître” in the French text) the listed rights and freedoms to persons within its own \n",
      "“jurisdiction”. “Jurisdiction” within the meaning of Article 1 is a threshold criterion. The exercise of \n",
      "jurisdiction is a necessary condition for a Contracting State to be able to be held responsible for acts \n",
      "or  omissions  imputable  to  it  which  give  rise  to  an  allegation  of  the  infringement  of  rights  and \n",
      "freedoms set forth in the Convention (Catan and Others v. the Republic of Moldova and Russia [GC], \n",
      "2012, § 103, and the case-law therein). \n",
      "\n",
      "2.  In  the  Convention  context,  the  term  jurisdiction  in  English  (in  French  sometimes  “compétence” \n",
      "and  sometimes  “juridiction”)  has  two  separate  but  related  senses.  The  first  corresponds  to  the \n",
      "Court’s  own  jurisdiction  (compétence)  on  the  basis,  in  particular,  of  Articles 19  and  32  of  the \n",
      "Convention,  to  receive  an  application  and  examine  it.  For  that  purpose  it  needs  to  establish  its \n",
      "jurisdiction  ratione  personae  (ascertaining  for  example  whether,  in  the  context  of  an  individual \n",
      "application,  an  applicant  may  be  regarded  as  a  “victim”  for  the  purposes  of  Article  34),  and  its \n",
      "jurisdiction ratione materiae (ascertaining for example whether the right relied upon is protected by \n",
      "the Convention and protocols thereto and whether the facts complained of fall within its scope). The \n",
      "Court has repeatedly pointed out that it must satisfy itself that it has jurisdiction in any case brought \n",
      "before  it  and  is  therefore  obliged  to examine  the  question of  its  jurisdiction  at  every  stage  of the \n",
      "proceedings (see, for example, Slovenia v. Croatia (dec.) [GC], 2020, or Svetova and Others v. Russia, \n",
      "2023,  §§ 23-28).  The  second  sense  relates  to  the  jurisdiction  (juridiction)  of  the  High  Contracting \n",
      "Parties, given that Article 1 obliges them to secure to “everyone within their jurisdiction” the rights \n",
      "and  freedoms  defined  in  the  Convention  (Ukraine  and  the  Netherlands  v. Russia  [GC]  (dec.),  2022, \n",
      "§§ 503-505). This guide will refer to jurisdiction in the latter sense. \n",
      "\n",
      "3.  Historically,  the  text  drawn  up  by  the  Committee  on  Legal  and  Administrative  Affairs  of  the \n",
      "Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe laid down, in what was to become Article 1 of the \n",
      "Convention,  that  “member  States  [should]  undertake  to  secure  to  everyone  residing  in  their \n",
      "territories  the  rights  ...”.  The  Committee  of  Intergovernmental  Experts  which  examined  the \n",
      "Consultative  Assembly’s  draft  decided  to  replace  the  words  “residing  in  their  territories”  with \n",
      "“within  their jurisdiction”.  The  reasons  for  that  amendment  are  described  in  the  following  extract \n",
      "from  the  Collected  Edition  of  the  Travaux  Préparatoires  of  the  European  Convention  on  Human \n",
      "Rights: \n",
      "\n",
      "“The  Assembly  draft  had  extended  the  benefits  of  the  Convention  to  ‘all  persons  residing  within  the \n",
      "territories  of  the  signatory  States’.  It  seemed  to  the  Committee  that  the  term  ‘residing’  might  be \n",
      "considered too restrictive. It was felt that there were  good grounds for extending the benefits of the \n",
      "Convention  to  all  persons  in  the  territories  of  the  signatory  States,  even  those  who  could  not  be \n",
      "considered as residing there in the legal sense of the word. The Committee therefore replaced the term \n",

      "4.  The  adoption  of  Article 1  of  the  Convention  was  also  preceded  by  a  comment  made  by  the \n",
      "Belgian  representative,  who,  on  25  August  1950  during  the  plenary  sitting  of  the  Consultative \n",
      "Assembly, said that: \n",
      "\n",
      "“... henceforth the right of protection by our States, by virtue of a formal clause of the Convention, may \n",

      "jurisdiction”,  did  not  give  rise  to  any  further  discussion  and  the  text  as  it  was  (and  is  now)  was \n",
      "adopted  by  the  Consultative  Assembly  on  25  August  1950  without  further  amendment  (Collected \n",

      "6.  The concept of “jurisdiction” for the purposes of Article 1 of the Convention must be considered \n",
      "to reflect the term’s meaning in public  international law  (Ukraine  v. Russia (re Crimea)  (dec.) [GC], \n",
      "2020, § 344). \n",
      "\n",
      "7.  Establishing  the  existence  of  “jurisdiction” within the  meaning  of  Article  1 of  the  Convention  is \n",
      "not necessarily determined by the merits of the case, and it is not therefore necessary to be left to \n",
      "be  determined  at  the  merits  stage  of  the  proceedings  (Ukraine  v. Russia  (re  Crimea)  (dec.)  [GC], \n",
      "2020,  § 265).  Accordingly,  there  is  nothing  to  prevent  the  Court  from  establishing  already  at  the \n",
      "preliminary (admissibility) stage whether the matters complained of by the applicant fall within the \n",
      "jurisdiction of the respondent Government (Ukraine and the Netherlands v. Russia [GC] (dec), 2022, \n",
      "§ 507).  In  any event,  the  question  whether  the  case  falls  within  the  jurisdiction  of  the  respondent \n",
      "State is a preliminary issue to be determined before any assessment of the merits of the substantive \n",
      "allegations  can  take  place  (Ukraine  v. Russia  (re  Crimea)  [GC]  (dec.),  2020,  § 264;  Ukraine  and  the \n",

      "raised  an  objection on  such  grounds  (Stephens  v. Malta  (no. 1),2009,  § 45;  Vasiliciuc  v. Republic  of \n",

      "the  respondent  State  and  whether  that  State  is  in  fact  responsible  for  those  acts  under  the \n",

      "at  the  merits  stage  (Loizidou  v. Turkey  (preliminary  objections),  1995,  §§ 61  and  64).  A  distinction \n",
