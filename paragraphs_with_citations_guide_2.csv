0,"The Court’s approach to the interpretation of Article 2 must be guided by the fact that the object and purpose of the Convention as an instrument for the protection of individual human beings requires that its provisions must be interpreted and applied so as to make its safeguards practical and effective (McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, 1995, § 146).",guide_art_2_eng,1,"{""001-57943"": ""CASE OF McCANN AND OTHERS v.

1,"Article 2 ranks as one of the most fundamental provisions in the Convention, one which in peace time, admits of no derogation under Article 15. Together with Article 3, it enshrines one of the basic values of the democratic societies making up the Council of Europe (Giuliani and Gaggio v. Italy [GC], 2011, § 174). As such, its provisions must be strictly construed (McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, 1995, § 147).",guide_art_2_eng,2,"{""001-57943"": ""CASE OF McCANN AND OTHERS v.

2,"Article 2 contains two substantive obligations: the general obligation to protect by law the right to life, and the prohibition of intentional deprivation of life, delimited by a list of exceptions (Boso v. Italy (dec.), 2002). Having regard to its fundamental character, Article 2 of the Convention also contains a procedural obligation to carry out an effective investigation into alleged breaches of its substantive limb (Armani Da Silva v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2016, § 229).",guide_art_2_eng,3,"{""001-57943"": ""CASE OF McCANN AND OTHERS v.

3,"The Court has emphasised on many occasions that Article 2 of the Convention may come into play even if a person whose right to life was allegedly breached did not die. In particular, the Court has held that in exceptional circumstances, depending on considerations such as the degree and type of force used and the nature of the injuries, use of force by State agents which does not result in death may disclose a violation of Article 2 of the Convention, if the behaviour of the State agents, by its very nature, puts the applicant’s life at serious risk even though the latter survives (Makaratzis v. Greece [GC], 2004, § 55; Soare and Others v. Romania, 2011, §§ 108-109; Trévalec v. Belgium, 2011, §§ 55- 61). In all other cases where a person is assaulted or ill-treated by State agents, their complaints will rather fall to be examined under Article 3 of the Convention (Makaratzis v. Greece [GC], 2004, § 51; İlhan v. Turkey [GC], 2000, § 76). In cases concerning applicants who survived a potentially lethal attack by non-State actors, the Court has adopted a similar approach to the one taken in respect of cases concerning use of force by State agents (Yotova v. Bulgaria, 2012, § 69).",guide_art_2_eng,4,"{""001-57943"": ""CASE OF McCANN AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM"", ""001-104098"": ""CASE OF GIULIANI AND GAGGIO v. ITALY"", ""001-23338"": ""BOSO v.

Thus, in circumstances where the competent authorities have become aware of a real and immediate risk to life triggering their duty to act, and have responded to the identified risk by taking appropriate measures within their powers in order to prevent that risk from materialising, the fact that such measures may nonetheless fail to achieve the desired result is not in itself capable of justifying the finding of a violation under this head. On the other hand, the Court observes that in this context, the assessment of the nature and level of risk constitutes an integral part of the duty to take preventive operational measures where the presence of a risk so requires. Thus, an examination of the State’s compliance with this duty under Article 2 must comprise an analysis of both the adequacy of the assessment of risk conducted by the domestic authorities and, where a relevant risk triggering the duty to act was or ought to have been identified, the adequacy of the preventive measures taken (Kurt v.

The Court has laid emphasis on the fact that the use of firearms entails a high level of inherent risk to life and that therefore the State had to put in place and rigorously apply a system of adequate and effective safeguards designed to counteract and prevent any improper and dangerous use of such weapons (Kotilainen and Others v. Finland, 2020, § 88).",guide_art_2_eng,26,"{""001-204603"": ""CASE OF KOTILAINEN AND OTHERS v. FINLAND"", ""001-208877"": ""CASE OF RIBCHEVA AND OTHERS v.

26,"The case of Ribcheva and Others v. Bulgaria, 2021, concerned the death of a law-enforcement officer during a planned operation. The Court considered that, when deciding to involve the applicants’ relative in the operation in his capacity as a specialised officer tasked with dealing with dangerous individuals, the authorities had a positive duty to do what could reasonably be expected of them to protect him from the risks of such an operation. In this respect, drawing on its well-established case-law, the Court emphasised that the standard of reasonableness in relation to this positive obligation (Article 2 § 1) was not as stringent as that in respect of the negative obligation (Article 2 § 2) to refrain from using force “more than absolutely necessary” (a strictly proportionate use of force excluding any margin of appreciation). Rather, the scope and content of the positive operational obligation at issue had to be defined in a way which does not impose an impossible or disproportionate burden on the authorities given the choices they face (priorities and resources) and given the unpredictability of human conduct (§ 165). On the basis of the information contained in the case-file, the Court found that, while the authorities had made mistakes in the planning and execution of the operation, the steps they had taken to minimise the risk to the officer’s life were reasonable (§180).",guide_art_2_eng,27,"{""001-204603"": ""CASE OF KOTILAINEN AND OTHERS v.

27,"In a recent domestic violence case where the applicants’ relative was killed by her husband, from whom she had been de facto separated for three years and who had been harassing her for nine months, the Court found that the authorities failed to respond immediately to the complaints of the deceased, save on one occasion, and failed to carry out any proactive, autonomous, and comprehensive risk assessment having regard to the context of domestic violence. It considered that, had the authorities carried out such a risk assessment, they would have appreciated that there was a real and immediate risk to the life of the applicants’ relative and they could have taken various steps, including ensuring proper coordination amongst themselves, to avert the risk to her life. The only preventive measure undertaken by the authorities, namely, protective orders remained without any tangible effect. Therefore, given the circumstances in the case, the authorities failed to take adequate preventive measures to protect the life of the applicants’ relative (Y and Others v. Bulgaria, 2022, §§ 91-110; see also Landi v.

In this connection, the Court considered that where a Contracting State has made adequate provision for securing high professional standards among health professionals and the protection of the lives of patients, matters such as an error of judgment on the part of a health professional or negligent coordination among health professionals in the treatment of a particular patient cannot be considered sufficient of themselves to call a Contracting State to account from the standpoint of its positive obligations under Article 2 of the Convention to protect life (Powell v. the United Kingdom (dec.), 2000; Dodov v.

Turkey, 2013) and, secondly, where a systemic or structural dysfunction in hospital services resulted in a patient being deprived of access to life-saving emergency treatment where the authorities knew about or ought to have known about that risk and failed to take the necessary measures to prevent that risk from materialising, thus putting the patients’ lives, including the life of the particular patient concerned, in danger (Aydoğdu v.

The Court emphasised the importance for individuals, who are facing risks to their health, to have access to information enabling them to assess those risks. In this regard, it considered that States were bound to adopt the necessary regulatory measures to ensure that doctors consider the foreseeable impact of a planned medical procedure on their patients’ physical integrity and to inform patients of these consequences beforehand in such a way that the latter are able to give informed consent (ibid, § 70). The Court underlined the need for persons with mental disabilities to enjoy heightened protection and that their participation in clinical trials be accompanied by particularly strong safeguards, with due account given to the particularities of their mental condition and its evolution over time (Ibid, 79). On the facts of the case, the Court considered that the implementation of the regulatory framework was deficient and that the guarantees concerning informed consent of participants of clinical trials had not been complied with.

In this respect, it noted that while the detailed arrangements governing the withdrawal of treatment vary from one country to another, there was nevertheless a consensus as to the paramount importance of the patient’s wishes in the decision-making process, however those wishes are expressed. It therefore considered that in this sphere concerning the end of life, as in that concerning the beginning of life, States must be afforded a margin of appreciation, not just as to whether or not to permit the withdrawal of artificial life-sustaining treatment and the detailed arrangements governing such withdrawal, but also as regards the means of striking a balance between the protection of patients’ right to life and the protection of their right to respect for their private life and their personal autonomy.

An exception was therefore included to the right to life, so that Article 2 § 1 provides that “no one shall be deprived of his life intentionally save in the execution of a sentence of a court following his conviction of a crime for which this penalty is provided by law”. However, there has subsequently been an evolution towards the complete de facto and de jure abolition of the death penalty within the member States of the Council of Europe (Al-Saadoon and Mufdhi v. the United Kingdom, 2010, § 116).",guide_art_2_eng,79,{}
79,"Protocol No. 6 to the Convention, which abolished the death penalty except in respect of “acts committed in time of war or of imminent threat of war”, was opened for signature on 28 April 1983 and came into force on 1 March 1985. All the member States of the Council of Europe have now signed Protocol No. 6 and all, save Russia, have ratified it (Al-Saadoon and Mufdhi v. the United Kingdom, 2010, § 116). Protocol No. 13, which abolishes the death penalty in all circumstances, was opened for signature on 3 May 2002 and came into force on 1 July 2003.

83,"As master of its own procedure and its own rules, the Court has complete freedom to assess not only the admissibility and relevance but also the probative value of each item of evidence before it. The Court is not bound, under the Convention or under the general principles applicable to international tribunals, by strict rules of evidence and there are no procedural barriers to the admissibility of evidence in the proceedings before it (Carter v. Russia, 2021, § 97).",guide_art_2_eng,84,{}
84,"However, the Court must be cautious in taking on the role of a first-instance tribunal of fact, where this is not rendered unavoidable by the circumstances of a particular case (McKerr v. the United Kingdom (dec.), 2000). As a general rule, where domestic proceedings have taken place, it is not the Court’s task to substitute its own assessment of the facts for that of the domestic courts and it is for the latter to establish the facts on the basis of the evidence before them (see, among many other authorities, Edwards v. the United Kingdom, 1992, § 34; Klaas v. Germany, 1993, § 29). Though the Court is not bound by the findings of domestic courts and remains free to make its own appreciation in the light of all the material before it, in normal circumstances it requires cogent elements to lead it to depart from the findings of fact reached by the domestic courts (Avşar v. Turkey, 2001, § 283; Barbu Anghelescu v. Romania, 2004, § 52). In this regard, the Court has underlined that its reliance on evidence obtained a result of a domestic investigation and on facts established within domestic proceedings depends on the quality of the domestic investigative process, and the thoroughness and consistency of the proceedings in question (Carter v. Russia, 2021, § 98).",guide_art_2_eng,85,{}
85,"A number of principles have been developed by the Court as regards applications in which it is faced with the task of establishing the facts of events on which the parties disagree: the factual findings should be based on the standard of proof “beyond reasonable doubt”; such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. In this context, the conduct of the parties when evidence is being obtained may also be taken into account (Tanış and Others v. Turkey, 2005, § 160; Tagayeva and Others v. Russia, 2017, § 586 and Kukhalashvili and Others v. Georgia, 2020, § 148).",guide_art_2_eng,86,{}
86,"The level of persuasion necessary for reaching a particular conclusion and, in this connection the distribution of the burden of proof are intrinsically linked to the specificity of the facts, the nature of the allegation made and the Convention right at stake (Tagayeva and Others v. Russia, 2017, § 586).",guide_art_2_eng,87,{}
87,"Where the events in issue lie wholly, or in large part, within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities, as in the case of persons within their control in custody, strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries and death occurring during such detention. Indeed, the burden of proof may be regarded as resting on the authorities to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation (Salman v. Turkey [GC], 2000, § 100).",guide_art_2_eng,88,{}
88,"This principle also applies to cases in which, although it has not been proved that a person has been taken into custody by the authorities, it is possible to establish that he or she was officially summoned by the military or the police, entered a place under their control and has not been seen since. In such circumstances, the onus is on the Government to provide a plausible explanation as to what happened on the premises and to show that the person concerned was not detained by the authorities, but left the premises without subsequently being deprived of his or her liberty (Tanış and Others v. Turkey, 2005, § 160).",guide_art_2_eng,89,{}
89,"Likewise, in cases concerning armed conflicts, the Court has further extended this principle to situations where individuals were found injured or dead, or disappeared, in areas of the State under the exclusive control of the authorities and where there was prima facie evidence that State agents could be involved (Akkum and Others v. Turkey, 2005, § 211; Aslakhanova and Others v. Russia, 2012, § 97 with further references).",guide_art_2_eng,90,{}
90,"For example, in a series of cases concerning allegations of disappearances in the Russian North Caucasus, the Court has considered it sufficient for the applicants to make a prima facie case of abduction by State agents, thus falling within the control of the authorities, and it would then be for the Government to discharge their burden of proof, either by disclosing documents in their exclusive possession or by providing a satisfactory and convincing explanation of how the events in question occurred. If the Government failed to discharge its burden of proof, this would entail a violation of Article 2 of the Convention in its substantive part. Conversely, if the applicants failed to make out a prima facie case, the burden of proof could not be reversed (Estemirova v. Russia, 2021, § 63).",guide_art_2_eng,91,{}
91,"In fact, the Court has underlined that, in all cases where it is unable to establish the exact circumstances of a case for reasons objectively attributable to the State authorities, it is for the respondent Government to explain, in a satisfactory and convincing manner, the sequence of events and to exhibit solid evidence that can refute the applicant’s allegations (Mansuroğlu v. Turkey, 2008, § 80 and Carter v. Russia, 2021, § 152). The Court has also noted the difficulties for applicants to obtain the necessary evidence in support of allegations in cases where the respondent Government are in possession of the relevant documentation and fail to submit it. If the authorities then fail to disclose crucial documents to enable the Court to establish the facts or otherwise provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation, strong inferences may be drawn (Varnava and Others v. Turkey [GC], 2009, § 184). The Court’s reliance on evidence obtained as a result of the domestic investigation and on the facts established within the domestic proceedings will largely depend on the quality of the domestic investigative process, its thoroughness and consistency (Tagayeva and Others v. Russia, 2017, § 586 and Lapshin v. Azerbaijan, 2021, § 95).",guide_art_2_eng,92,{}
92,"Finally, when there have been criminal proceedings in the domestic courts concerning those same allegations, it must be borne in mind that criminal law liability is distinct from international law responsibility under the Convention. The Court’s competence is confined to the latter. Responsibility under the Convention is based on its own provisions which are to be interpreted and applied on the basis of the objectives of the Convention and in the light of the relevant principles of international law. The responsibility of a State under the Convention, arising for the acts of its organs, agents and servants, is not to be confused with the domestic legal issues of individual criminal responsibility under examination in the national criminal courts. The Court is not concerned with reaching any findings as to guilt or innocence in that sense (Tanlı v. Turkey, 2001, § 111; Giuliani and Gaggio v. Italy [GC], 2011, § 182).",guide_art_2_eng,93,{}
93,"In the context of use of force by State agents, the primary duty on the State to secure the right to life entails, in particular, putting in place an appropriate legal and administrative framework defining the limited circumstances in which law enforcement may use force and firearms, in the light of the relevant international standards (Giuliani and Gaggio v. Italy [GC], 2011, § 209; Makaratzis v. Greece [GC], 2004, §§ 57-59).",guide_art_2_eng,94,{}
94,"In line with the principle of strict proportionality inherent in Article 2, the national legal framework must make recourse to firearms dependent on a careful assessment of the situation (Giuliani and Gaggio v. Italy [GC], 2011, § 209) and, in particular, on an evaluation of the nature of the offence committed by the person in question and of the threat he or she posed (Nachova and Others v. Bulgaria [GC], 2005, § 96). Furthermore, the national law regulating policing operations must secure a system of adequate and effective safeguards against arbitrariness and abuse of force and even against avoidable accident (Giuliani and Gaggio v. Italy [GC], 2011, § 209; Makaratzis v. Greece [GC], 2004, § 58).",guide_art_2_eng,95,{}
95,"The Court, distinguishing between “routine police operations” and situations of large-scale anti- terrorist operations, held that, in the latter case, often in situations of acute crisis requiring “tailor- made” responses, States should be able to rely on solutions that would be appropriate to the circumstances. That being said, it has also underlined that, in a lawful security operation which is aimed, in the first place, at protecting the lives of people who find themselves in danger of unlawful violence from third parties, the use of lethal force remains governed by the strict rules of “absolute necessity” within the meaning of Article 2 of the Convention. Thus, it is of primary importance that the domestic regulations be guided by the same principle and contain clear indications to that extent, including the obligations to decrease the risk of unnecessary harm and exclude the use of weapons and ammunition that carry unwarranted consequences (Tagayeva and Others v. Russia, 2017, § 595).",guide_art_2_eng,96,{}
96,"The Court has underlined that law enforcement agents must be trained to assess whether or not there is an absolute necessity to use firearms, not only on the basis of the letter of the relevant regulations, but also with due regard to the pre-eminence of respect for human life as a fundamental value (Nachova and Others v. Bulgaria [GC], 2005, § 97; Kakoulli v. Turkey, 2005, § 110).",guide_art_2_eng,97,{}
97,"For example, in cases concerning the use of force to quell a riot or insurrection, the Court’s assessment includes an examination as to whether the security forces were properly equipped (Güleç v. Turkey, 1998, § 71; Şimşek and Others v. Turkey, 2005, § 117); whether they received effective training with the objective of complying with international standards for human rights and policing and whether they received clear and precise instructions as to the manner and circumstances in which they make use of firearms (ibid., § 109). In particular, the Court has underlined that opening fire should, whenever possible, be preceded by warning shots (Giuliani and Gaggio v. Italy [GC], 2011, § 177).",guide_art_2_eng,98,{}
98,"Moreover, States are expected to set high professional standards within their law-enforcement systems and ensure that law-enforcement officers meet the requisite criteria. In particular, when equipping police forces with firearms, not only must the necessary technical training be given, but the selection of agents allowed to carry such firearms must also be subject to particular scrutiny (Sašo Gorgiev v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, 2012, § 51).",guide_art_2_eng,99,{}
99,"Applying these principles, the Court has, for instance, characterised as deficient the Bulgarian legal framework which permitted the police to fire on any fugitive member of the armed forces who did not surrender immediately in response to an oral warning and the firing of a warning shot in the air. There were no clear safeguards to prevent the arbitrary deprivation of life (Nachova and Others v. Bulgaria [GC], 2005, §§ 99-102).",guide_art_2_eng,100,{}
100,"Likewise the Court has also identified deficiencies in the Turkish legal framework, adopted in 1934, which listed a wide range of situations in which a police officer could use firearms without being liable for the consequences (Erdoğan and Others v. Turkey, 2006, §§ 77-79). On the other hand, in another case, it considered that a regulation setting out an exhaustive list of situations in which gendarmes could make use of firearms was compatible with the Convention. That regulation specified that the use of firearms should only be envisaged as a last resort and had to be preceded by warning shots, before shots were fired at the legs or indiscriminately (Bakan v. Turkey, 2007, § 51).",guide_art_2_eng,101,{}
101,"In the case of Makaratzis v. Greece [GC], 2004, which concerned a chaotic police chase in which the applicant, who had ignored a red light, was seriously injured by gun shots, the Court found that Greece’s domestic law did not afford law-enforcement officials clear guidelines and criteria governing the use of force in peacetime. It also found that, in the absence of proper training and instructions, it was unavoidable that the police officers who chased and eventually arrested the applicant enjoyed a greater autonomy of action and were able to take unconsidered initiatives (§ 70).",guide_art_2_eng,102,{}
102,"The Court held that the authorities had failed to properly vet a police officer before issuing him a firearm in Gorovenky and Bugara v. Ukraine, 2012, § 39, where an off-duty police officer, involved in a quarrel, opened fire with his service weapon killing the applicants’ relatives. See also Sašo Gorgiev v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, 2012, § 52.",guide_art_2_eng,103,{}
103,"The exceptions delineated in paragraph 2 indicate that Article 2 extends to, but is not concerned exclusively with, intentional killing. The text of Article 2, read as a whole, demonstrates that paragraph 2 does not primarily define instances where it is permitted to kill an individual, but describes the situations where it is permitted to “use force” which may result, as an unintended outcome, in the deprivation of life. The use of force, however, must be no more than “absolutely necessary” for the achievement of one of the purposes set out in sub-paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) (McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, 1995, § 148; Yüksel Erdoğan and Others v. Turkey, 2007, § 86; Ramsahai and Others v. the Netherlands [GC], 2007, § 286; Giuliani and Gaggio v. Italy [GC], 2011, § 17).",guide_art_2_eng,104,{}
104,"As a rule, the use of the term “absolutely necessary” in Article 2 § 2 indicates that a stricter and more compelling test of necessity must be employed than that normally applicable when determining whether State action is “necessary in a democratic society” under paragraph 2 of Articles 8 to 11 of the Convention. In particular, the force used must be strictly proportionate to the achievement of the aims set out in sub-paragraphs 2 (a), (b) and (c) (McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, 1995, § 149).",guide_art_2_eng,105,{}
105,"That being said, the Court has underlined that it is acutely conscious of the difficulties faced by modern States in the fight against terrorism and the dangers of hindsight analysis. In this connection, it has underlined the need to differentiate between the political choices made in the course of fighting terrorism, that remain by their nature outside of such supervision, and other, more operational aspects of the authorities’ actions that have a direct bearing on the protected rights. Therefore, the absolute necessity test formulated in Article 2 is bound to be applied with different degrees of scrutiny, depending on whether and to what extent the authorities were in control of the situation and other relevant constraints inherent in operative decision-making in this sensitive sphere (Tagayeva and Others v. Russia, 2017, § 481).",guide_art_2_eng,106,{}
106,"In the specific context of hostage rescue operations the Court has held that, normally, the planning and conduct of the rescue operation can be subjected to a heightened scrutiny. In doing so, the Court has taken into account the following factors: (i) whether the operation was spontaneous or whether the authorities could have reflected on the situation and made specific preparations; (ii) whether the authorities were in a position to rely on some generally prepared emergency plan, not related to that particular crisis; (iii) that the degree of control of the situation is higher outside the building, where most of the rescue efforts take place; and (iv) that the more predictable a hazard, the greater the obligation is to protect against it (Tagayeva and Others v. Russia, 2017, § 563).",guide_art_2_eng,107,{}
107,"In keeping with the importance of this provision in a democratic society, the Court must, in making its assessment, subject deprivations of life to the most careful scrutiny, particularly where deliberate lethal force is used, taking into consideration not only the actions of the agents of the State who actually administer the force but also all the surrounding circumstances, including such matters as the planning and control of the actions under examination (McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, 1995, § 150; Ergi v. Turkey, 1998, § 79).",guide_art_2_eng,108,{}
108,"It goes without saying that a balance must be struck between the aim pursued and the means employed to achieve it (Güleç v. Turkey, 1998, § 71).",guide_art_2_eng,109,{}
109,"For example, the Court has underlined that the legitimate aim of effecting a lawful arrest can only justify putting human life at risk in circumstances of absolute necessity. Therefore in principle there can be no such necessity where it is known that the person to be arrested poses no threat to life or limb and is not suspected of having committed a violent offence, even if a failure to use lethal force may result in the opportunity to arrest the individual concerned being lost (Nachova and Others v. Bulgaria [GC], 2005, § 95; Kakoulli v. Turkey, 2005, § 108).",guide_art_2_eng,110,{}
110,"Likewise, in the context of border control, the Court emphasised that while Contracting States may, in principle, put arrangements in place at their borders designed to prevent unauthorised entry into the territory as well as use the force necessary to prevent illegal entry to the territory, the need for border control cannot justify resort to practices which are not compatible with the Convention or the Protocols thereto (Bişar Ayhan v. Turkey, 2021, § 65).",guide_art_2_eng,111,{}
111,"The use of force by agents of the State in pursuit of one of the aims delineated in paragraph 2 of Article 2 of the Convention may be justified under this provision where it is based on an honest belief which is perceived, for good reasons, to be valid at the time but subsequently turns out to be mistaken. To hold otherwise would be to impose an unrealistic burden on the State and its law-enforcement personnel in the execution of their duty, perhaps to the detriment of their lives and the lives of others (McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, 1995, § 200; Andronicou and Constantinou v. Cyprus, 1997, § 192; Bubbins v. the United Kingdom, 2005, § 138; Huohvanainen v. Finland, 2007, § 96).",guide_art_2_eng,112,{}
112,"The Court had also added that, detached from the events in issue, it cannot substitute its own assessment of the situation for that of an officer who was required to react in the heat of the moment to avert an honestly perceived danger to his life or the lives of others (Bubbins v. the United Kingdom, 2005, § 139; Huohvanainen v. Finland, 2007, § 97).",guide_art_2_eng,113,{}
113,"When examining the actions of the State agents the principal question to be addressed is whether the person had an honest and genuine belief that the use of force was necessary. In addressing this question, the Court will have to consider whether the belief was subjectively reasonable, having full regard to the circumstances that pertained at the relevant time. If the belief was not subjectively reasonable (that is, it was not based on subjective good reasons), it is likely that the Court would have difficulty accepting that it was honestly and genuinely held (see Armani Da Silva v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2016, § 248, albeit in the context of procedural obligations). ii. The planning and control of the operation",guide_art_2_eng,114,{}
114,"In determining whether the force used is compatible with Article 2, it may therefore be relevant whether a law enforcement operation has been planned and controlled so as to minimise to the greatest extent possible recourse to lethal force or incidental loss of life (Bubbins v. the United Kingdom, 2005, § 136; Huohvanainen v. Finland, 2007, § 94).",guide_art_2_eng,115,{}
115,"In carrying out its assessment of the planning and control phase of the operation from the standpoint of Article 2 of the Convention, the Court must have particular regard to the context in which the incident occurred as well as to the way in which the situation developed (Andronicou and Constantinou v. Cyprus, 1997, §182; Yüksel Erdoğan and Others v. Turkey, 2007, § 86).",guide_art_2_eng,116,{}
116,"Its sole concern must be to evaluate whether in the circumstances the planning and control of the operation showed that the authorities had taken appropriate care to ensure that any risk to his life had been minimised and that they were not negligent in their choice of action (Bubbins v. the United Kingdom, 2005, § 141). iii.

119,"In a number of cases where death was hastened by the use of specific arrest techniques which were not lethal by themselves, the Court examined whether there was a causal link between the force used and the death of the individual and whether State agents protected the right to life by providing that individual with requisite medical assistance (Scavuzzo-Hager and Others v. Switzerland, 2006, § 55, which concerned the arrest by police officers of a very agitated drug addict who subsequently died; see also Saoud v. France, 2007, which concerned the death by gradual asphyxia of a young man who was handcuffed and held face down on the ground by police officers for over thirty minutes; Boukrourou and Others v. France, 2017, where the applicants’ relative, a mentally disabled person, died during a police operation from heart failure, Kutsarovi v. Bulgaria, 2022, where the applicant’s son died from a cardiac arrest during his police transfer while in the vehicle and Semache v.

120,"Persons in custody are in a vulnerable position and the authorities are under a duty to protect them. Consequently, when an individual is taken into police custody in good health and is found to be injured on release, it is incumbent on the State to provide a plausible explanation of how those injuries were caused. The obligation on the authorities to account for the treatment of an individual in custody is particularly stringent where that individual dies (Salman v. Turkey [GC], 2000, § 99; Tanlı v. Turkey, 2001, § 141; Tekın and Arslan v. Belgium, 2017, § 83).",guide_art_2_eng,121,{}

122,The Court has also been confronted with applications where it is undisputed that the applicants’ relatives died in circumstances falling outside the exceptions set out in the second paragraph of Article,guide_art_2_eng,123,{}
123,"However, even in circumstances where the Court cannot establish beyond reasonable doubt that any State agent was involved in the killing, the Court may nonetheless find the respondent State responsible, if it considers that the authorities failed to take reasonable measures available to them to protect the right to life of the applicant in question (Mahmut Kaya v. Turkey, 2000, §§ 87 and 101; Kılıç v. Turkey, 2000, §§ 64 and 77; Gongadze v. Ukraine, 2005, §§ 170-171; and by contrast Denizci and Others v. Cyprus, 2001, §§ 374 and 377).",guide_art_2_eng,124,{}
124,"In the particular context of security operations, the Court has held that the responsibility of the State is not confined to circumstances where there is significant evidence that misdirected fire from State agents has killed a civilian. It may also be engaged where they fail to take all feasible precautions in the choice of means and methods for a security operation mounted against an opposing group with a view to avoiding and, in any event, to minimising incidental loss of civilian life (Ahmet Özkan and Others v. Turkey, 2004, § 297).",guide_art_2_eng,125,{}
125,"In this context, the Court has found, for example, that:  the military had undertaken insufficient precautions to protect the lives of the civilian population (Ergi v. Turkey, 1998, § 81, where the applicant’s sister was killed in the course of an ambush operation conducted by the security forces against the PKK);  while the security forces’ choice to open intensive fire in response to shots fired at them from a village was “absolutely necessary” for the purpose of protecting life, Turkey had failed in its obligations to protect life under Article 2 because the security forces failed subsequently to verify whether there were any civilian casualties (Ahmet Özkan and Others v. Turkey, 2004, §§ 306-308, concerning a military raid conducted on a village in order to capture terrorists leading to the death of two children);  the military operation was not planned and executed with the requisite care for the lives of the civilians (Isayeva and Others v. Russia, 2005, § 199, which concerned the bombing of a convoy by Russian military jets during the Chechen war, with loss of civilian life); see also Abuyeva and Others v. Russia, 2010, § 203; and Benzer and Others v. Turkey, 2013, § 184, where the Court reiterated that an indiscriminate aerial bombing of civilians and their villages could not be acceptable in a democratic society or reconcilable with any of the grounds regulating the use of force set out in Article 2 § 2 of the Convention, the customary rules of international humanitarian law or any of the international treaties regulating the use of force in armed conflicts. In the case of Şirin Yılmaz v. Turkey, 2004, where the applicant’s wife was killed by artillery shells, the Court was unable to conclude that she was, beyond reasonable doubt, intentionally or recklessly killed by the security forces (§ 76; see also Zengin v. Turkey, 2004, § 44).   By contrast, the Court found that the wounding of the first applicant and the killing of the remaining applicants’ relative from the firing of mortars by soldiers near the Iranian border as they were illegally crossing over through a prohibited military area constituted a disproportionate use of force which was not absolutely necessary (Bişar Ayhan v. Turkey, 2021, § 74).",guide_art_2_eng,126,{}
126,"The Court has further underlined that Article 2 must be interpreted in so far as possible in light of the general principles of international law, including the rules of international humanitarian law which play an indispensable and universally accepted role in mitigating the savagery and inhumanity of armed conflict. In a zone of international conflict Contracting States are under an obligation to protect the lives of those not, or no longer, engaged in hostilities. This would also extend to the provision of medical assistance to the wounded; where combatants have died, or succumbed to wounds, the need for accountability would necessitate proper disposal of remains and require the authorities to collect and provide information about the identity and fate of those concerned, or permit bodies such as the International Committee of the Red Cross to do so (Varnava and Others v. Turkey [GC], 2009, § 185). Therefore, even in situations of international armed conflict, the safeguards under the Convention continue to apply, albeit interpreted against the background of the provisions of international humanitarian law (Hassan v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2014, § 104).",guide_art_2_eng,127,{}
127,"Where an individual is taken into custody in good health but is found to be injured at the time of release, it is incumbent on the State to provide a plausible explanation of how those injuries were caused, failing which an issue arises under Article 3 of the Convention. In the same vein, Article 5 imposes an obligation on the State to account for the whereabouts of any person taken into detention and who has thus been placed under the control of the authorities. Whether the failure on the part of the authorities to provide a plausible explanation as to a detainee’s fate, in the absence of a body, might also raise issues under Article 2 of the Convention will depend on all the circumstances of the case, and in particular on the existence of sufficient circumstantial evidence, based on concrete elements, from which it may be concluded to the requisite standard of proof that the detainee must be presumed to have died in custody (Timurtaş v. Turkey, 2000, § 82).",guide_art_2_eng,128,{}
128,"In this respect the period of time which has elapsed since the person was placed in detention, although not decisive in itself, is a relevant factor to be taken into account. It must be accepted that the more time goes by without any news of the detained person, the greater the likelihood that he or she has died. The passage of time may therefore to some extent affect the weight to be attached to other elements of circumstantial evidence before it can be concluded that the person concerned is to be presumed dead. In this respect the Court considers that this situation gives rise to issues which go beyond a mere irregular detention in violation of Article 5. Such an interpretation is in keeping with the effective protection of the right to life as afforded by Article 2, which ranks as one of the most fundamental provisions of the Convention (Tanış and Others v. Turkey, 2005, § 201).",guide_art_2_eng,129,{}
129,"However, this presumption of death is not automatic and is only reached on examination of the circumstances of the case, in which the lapse of time since the person was seen alive or heard from is a relevant element (Varnava and Others v. Turkey [GC], 2009, § 143; Aslakhanova and Others v. Russia, 2012, § 100).",guide_art_2_eng,130,{}
130,"Moreover, a finding of State involvement in the disappearance of a person is not a condition sine qua non for the purposes of establishing whether that person can be presumed dead; in certain circumstances the disappearance of a person may in itself be considered as life-threatening (Medova v. Russia, 2009, § 90).",guide_art_2_eng,131,{}
131,"For example, in the context of the conflict in Chechnya, the Court has concluded that when a person is detained by unidentified servicemen without any subsequent acknowledgement of detention, this can be regarded as life-threatening (Baysayeva v. Russia, 2007, § 119; Beksultanova v. Russia, 2011, § 83).",guide_art_2_eng,132,{}
132,"Likewise, the Court has deemed that the disappearance of a person in south-east Turkey between 1992 and 1996 could be regarded as life-threatening (Osmanoğlu v. Turkey, 2008, §§ 57-58; Meryem Çelik and Others v. Turkey, 2013, § 58), particularly if that person was suspected by the authorities of PKK involvement (Enzile Özdemir v. Turkey, 2008, § 45).",guide_art_2_eng,133,{}
133,"Once the Court considers that it has been established beyond reasonable doubt that the disappeared person must be presumed dead following his or her unacknowledged detention by State agents, the responsibility of the State is engaged. Since such circumstances do not provide any justification on any of the grounds listed in Article 2 § 2 of the Convention, the Court finds the respondent Government liable for the presumed death of the disappeared person (Akdeniz and Others v. Turkey, 2001, § 101; Orhan v. Turkey, 2002, § 331; İpek v. Turkey, 2004, § 168; Bazorkina v. Russia, 2006, § 111; Magomadov v. Russia, 2007, § 99; Meryem Çelik and Others v.

Turkey, 2005, § 132; Osmanoğlu v. Turkey, 2008, § 75)2.",guide_art_2_eng,135,{}
135,"In this connection, any negligence displayed by the investigating or supervising authorities in the face of real and imminent threats to an identified individual’s life emanating from State agents who were acting outside their legal duties may entail a violation of the positive obligation to protect life (Gongadze v.

136,"In a recent case, where a young woman with schizophrenia went missing, the Court found that the authorities, who were aware of the existence of a real and immediate risk of suicide, took immediate and appropriate action with a view to finding her alive. The State’s substantive obligation to protect the right to life was therefore fulfilled (Goncalves Monteiro v. Portugal, 2022, § 118; see also Tunç v. Turkey (dec.), 2022, §§ 82-83, where the Court found no indication that the authorities knew or ought to have known that there was a real and immediate risk to the life of the applicants’ relative, who had disappeared while criminal proceedings were pending against him for his alleged involvement in a terrorist organisation and thus no indication that they had failed to take measures which could reasonably have been expected of them).",guide_art_2_eng,137,{}
137,"A Contracting State will be responsible under the Convention for violations of human rights caused by acts of its agents carried out in the performance of their duties (Krastanov v. Bulgaria, 2004, § 53). Whether a person is an agent of the State for the purposes of the Convention is defined on the basis of a multitude of criteria, one of them being functional (Fergec v. Croatia, 2017, § 36). The Court has also held that, where the behaviour of a State agent is unlawful, the question of whether the impugned acts can be imputed to the State requires an assessment of the totality of the circumstances and consideration of the nature and circumstances of the conduct in question (Sašo Gorgiev v. the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, 2012, §§ 47-48).",guide_art_2_eng,138,{}
138,"In particular, the Court has found that States are, in principle, not directly responsible for any killing or injury committed by State agents in their private capacity unless those agents made use of their position while committing the unlawful act in question with at least the connivance or acquiescence by the authorities irrespective of whether the agent concerned had been on or off-duty at the time of the events (Enukidze and Girgvliani v. Georgia, 2011, § 290; Kotelnikov v. Russia, 2016, § 93; Fergec v. Croatia, 2017, § 36).",guide_art_2_eng,139,{}

140,"In a recent case where an Azerbaijani officer killed an Armenian officer and threatened to kill another Armenian soldier while taking part in a NATO course in Budapest, the Court considered that Azerbaijan could not be held responsible for the acts in question. In this respect, it attached crucial importance to the fact that the perpetrator was not acting in the exercise of his official duties or on the orders of his superiors. The Court also rejected the applicants’ argument, based on Article 11 of the UN Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States of Internationally Wrongful Acts: while the 2 See Section “Protection of life”. measures taken by the Azerbaijani Government manifestly demonstrated its “approval” and “endorsement” of the perpetrator’s criminal acts, it was not convincingly demonstrated that Azerbaijan had “clearly and unequivocally” “acknowledged” and “adopted” his acts “as its own”, thus directly and categorically assuming, as such, responsibility for the actual killing of one victim and the attempted murder of another (Makuchyan and Minasyan v. Azerbaijan and Hungary, 2020, §§ 111- 118).",guide_art_2_eng,141,{}
141,"By contrast, in a case which concerned the targeted killing of a Russian political defector and dissident in the United Kingdom with a high level of polonium 210, the Court, given the prima facie evidence of State involvement which the respondent Government failed to displace, found that the two Russian individuals, which the domestic inquiry in the United Kingdom had established as the perpetrators, were acting as State agents and that the act complained of was thus attributable to Russia (Carter v. Russia, 2021, §§ 162-169).",guide_art_2_eng,142,{}
142,"The procedural obligations of the State was first formulated in the context of the use of lethal force by State agents where the Court held that a general legal prohibition of arbitrary killing by the agents of the State would be ineffective, in practice, if there existed no procedure for reviewing the lawfulness of the use of lethal force by State authorities. The Court underlined that the obligation to protect the right to life under this provision, read in conjunction with the State’s general duty under Article 1 of the Convention to “secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in the Convention”, requires by implication that there should be some form of effective official investigation when individuals have been killed as a result of the use of force by, inter alios, agents of the State (McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom, 1995, § 161).",guide_art_2_eng,143,{}
143,"Since then the Court has accepted that this obligation arises in a variety of situations where an individual has sustained life-threatening injuries, died or has disappeared in violent or suspicious circumstances, irrespective of whether those allegedly responsible are State agents or private persons or are unknown or self-inflicted (see, for example, concerning inter-prisoner violence: Paul and Audrey Edwards v. the United Kingdom, 2002, § 69; concerning homicides by prisoners benefiting from early release or social re-integration schemes: Maiorano and Others v. Italy, 2009, §§ 123-26; concerning high-profile assassinations: Kolevi v. Bulgaria, 2009, §§ 191-215; concerning domestic violence: Opuz v. Turkey, 2009, § 150; concerning suspicious deaths or disappearances: Iorga v. Moldova, 2010, § 26; Tahsin Acar v. Turkey [GC], 2004, § 226; concerning suicide: Trubnikov v. Russia, 2005; Mosendz v. Ukraine, 2013, § 92; Vasîlca v. the Republic of Moldova, 2014, § 28). This stems from Article 2 which imposes a duty on that State to secure the right to life by putting in place effective criminal-law provisions to deter the commission of offences against the person, backed up by law-enforcement machinery for the prevention, suppression and punishment of breaches of such provisions. This obligation requires by implication that there should be some form of effective official investigation when there is reason to believe that an individual has sustained life-threatening injuries in suspicious circumstances, even where the presumed perpetrator of the fatal attack is not a State agent (Mustafa Tunç and Fecire Tunç v. Turkey [GC], 2015, § 171).",guide_art_2_eng,144,{}
144,"The Court has further extended the scope of this obligation to circumstances where an individual has sustained life-threatening injuries or where lives have been lost in circumstances potentially engaging the responsibility of the State due to alleged negligence (see, for example, in the context of healthcare: Lopes de Sousa Fernandes v. Portugal [GC], 2017, § 214; and road traffic accidents: Anna Todorova v. Bulgaria, 2011, § 72). In such cases, the Court has held that Article 2 of the Convention must also be considered to require the State to have in place an effective independent judicial system so as to secure legal means capable of establishing the facts, holding accountable those at fault and providing appropriate redress to the victim (Sinim v. Turkey, 2017, § 59; Ciechońska v. Poland, 2011, § 66). In such cases, the Court has transposed, with certain adaptions and in a piecemeal fashion, the general principles regarding the duty to investigate, notably; the minimum required standards3.",guide_art_2_eng,145,{}
145,"When the victim of a lethal attack is a State agent carrying out his official duties, the Court has underlined that the procedural obligation of the State required an additional investigation as to whether negligent acts or omissions on the part of officials had also directly contributed to that death (Ribcheva and Others v. Bulgaria, 2021, §§ 125-130).",guide_art_2_eng,146,{}
146,"The State’s obligation to carry out an effective investigation has in the Court’s case-law been considered as an obligation inherent in Article 2, which requires, inter alia, that the right to life be “protected by law”. Although the failure to comply with such an obligation may have consequences for the right protected under Article 13, the procedural obligation of Article 2 is seen as a distinct obligation (İlhan v. Turkey [GC], 2000, §§ 91-92; Šilih v. Slovenia [GC], 2009, §§ 153-154). It can give rise to a finding of a separate and independent “interference”. This conclusion derives from the fact that the Court has consistently examined the question of procedural obligations separately from the question of compliance with the substantive obligation (and, where appropriate, has found a separate violation of Article 2 on that account) and the fact that on several occasions a breach of a procedural obligation under Article 2 has been alleged in the absence of any complaint as to its substantive aspect (Armani Da Silva v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2016, § 231).",guide_art_2_eng,147,{}
147,"The essential purpose of an investigation under Article 2 is to secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws safeguarding the right to life and, in those cases involving State agents or bodies, to ensure their accountability for deaths occurring under their responsibility (Hugh Jordan v. the United Kingdom, 2001, § 105; Nachova and Others v. Bulgaria [GC], 2005, § 110; Al-Skeini and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2011, § 163).",guide_art_2_eng,148,{}
148,"What form of investigation will achieve the purposes of Article 2 may vary depending on the circumstances. However, whatever mode is employed, the authorities must act of their own motion once the matter has come to their attention. They cannot leave it to the initiative of the next-of-kin either to lodge a formal complaint or to take responsibility for the conduct of any investigative procedures (Al-Skeini and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2011, § 165).",guide_art_2_eng,149,{}
149,"In the context of killings allegedly perpetrated by or in collusion with State agents, civil proceedings, which are undertaken on the initiative of the next-of-kin, not the authorities, and which do not involve the identification or punishment of any alleged perpetrator, cannot be taken into account in the assessment of the State’s compliance with its procedural obligations under Article 2 of the Convention (Hugh Jordan v. the United Kingdom, 2001, § 141) because, in such cases, the procedural obligation of the State under Article 2 cannot be satisfied merely by awarding damages (McKerr v. the United Kingdom (dec.), 2000, § 121; Bazorkina v. Russia, 2006, § 117; Al-Skeini and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2011, § 165).",guide_art_2_eng,150,{}
150,"The Court has explained that this is because in cases of homicide the interpretation of Article 2 as entailing an obligation to conduct an official investigation is justified not only because any allegations of such an offence normally give rise to criminal liability, but also because often, in practice, in the context of killings allegedly perpetrated by or in collusion with State agents, the true circumstances of the death are, or may be, largely confined within the knowledge of State officials or authorities so that the bringing of appropriate domestic proceedings such as a criminal prosecution, disciplinary proceedings and proceedings for the exercise of remedies available to victims and their families, will be conditioned by an adequate official investigation (Makaratzis v. Greece [GC], 2004, § 73; Khashiyev and Akayeva v. Russia, 2005, §§ 120-121).",guide_art_2_eng,151,{}
151,"The nature and degree of scrutiny which satisfy the minimum threshold of the investigation’s effectiveness depends on the circumstances of the particular case. It must be assessed on the basis of all relevant facts and with regard to the practical realities of investigation work (Centre for Legal Resources on behalf of Valentin Câmpeanu v. Romania [GC], 2014, § 147). It is not possible to reduce the variety of situations which might occur to a bare check-list of acts of investigation or other simplified criteria (Velikova v. Bulgaria, 2000, § 80).",guide_art_2_eng,152,{}
152,"Where a suspicious death has been inflicted at the hands of a State agent, particularly stringent scrutiny must be applied by the relevant domestic authorities to the ensuing investigation (Enukidze and Girgvliani v. Georgia, 2011, § 277; Armani Da Silva v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2016, § 234).",guide_art_2_eng,153,{}
153,"In the context of disappearances, having regard to the fact that a disappearance is a distinct phenomenon, characterised by an ongoing situation of uncertainty and unaccountability in which there is a lack of information or even a deliberate concealment and obfuscation of what has occurred and that this situation is very often drawn out over time, prolonging the torment of the victim’s relatives with the additional distinctive element of subsequent failure to account for the whereabouts and fate of the missing person gives rise to a continuing situation. Thus, in such cases, the procedural obligation will, potentially, persist as long as the fate of the person is unaccounted for; the ongoing failure to provide the requisite investigation will be regarded as a continuing violation. This is so, even where death may, eventually, be presumed (Varnava and Others v. Turkey [GC], 2009, § 148).",guide_art_2_eng,154,{}
154,"In cases of contract killing, the Court took the view that the investigation could not be considered adequate in the absence of genuine and serious investigative efforts taken with the view to identifying the intellectual author of the crime, that is, the person or people who had commissioned the assassination. In such cases the domestic authorities’ scrutiny had to aim to go beyond identification of a hitman (Mazepa and Others v. Russia, 2018, §§ 75-79; see also Nemtsova v. Russia, 2023, §§ 111 and 116).",guide_art_2_eng,155,{}
155,"Where the victim of a killing is a journalist, the Court, referring to Recommendation CM/Rec (2016) 4 on the protection of journalism and safety of journalists and other media actors, has considered that it was of utmost importance to check a possible connection of the crime to the journalist’s professional activity (Mazepa and Others v. Russia, 2018, § 73).",guide_art_2_eng,156,{}
156,"Similarly, where the victim was a prominent politician and an opposition leader, the Court considered that it was vital to explore whether there was a possible political motive for his murder and whether certain State officials could have been involved (Nemtsova v. Russia, 2023, §§ 117 -127; see also Navalnyy v. Russia (No. 3), where the authorities refused to institute criminal proceedings into the attempted murder of a prominent opposition figure with a substance identified as a chemical nerve agent).",guide_art_2_eng,157,{}
157,"For an investigation into alleged unlawful killing by State agents to be effective, it may generally be regarded as necessary for the persons responsible for and carrying out the investigation to be independent from those implicated in the events. This means not only a lack of hierarchical or institutional connection but also a practical independence. What is at stake here is nothing less than public confidence in the State’s monopoly on the use of force (Armani Da Silva v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2016, § 232).",guide_art_2_eng,158,{}
158,"The requirements of Article 2 call for a concrete examination of the independence of the investigation in its entirety, rather than an abstract assessment (Mustafa Tunç and Fecire Tunç v. Turkey [GC], 2015, § 222).",guide_art_2_eng,159,{}
159,"Moreover, Article 2 does not require that the persons and bodies responsible for the investigation enjoy absolute independence, but rather that they are sufficiently independent of the persons and structures whose responsibility is likely to be engaged. The adequacy of the degree of independence is assessed in the light of all the circumstances, which are necessarily specific to each case (ibid., § 223).",guide_art_2_eng,160,{}
160,"However, where the statutory or institutional independence is open to question, such a situation, although not decisive, will call for a stricter scrutiny on the part of the Court of whether the investigation has been carried out in an independent manner. Where an issue arises concerning the independence and impartiality of an investigation, the correct approach consists in examining whether and to what extent the disputed circumstance has compromised the investigation’s effectiveness and its ability to shed light on the circumstances of the death and to punish those responsible (ibid, § 224).",guide_art_2_eng,161,{}
161,"In this respect, the Court has emphasised that public prosecutors inevitably rely on the police for information and support and that this is not in itself sufficient to conclude that they lack sufficient independence vis-à-vis the police. Rather, problems arise if a public prosecutor has a close working relationship with a particular police force (Ramsahai and Others v. the Netherlands [GC], 2007, § 344).",guide_art_2_eng,162,{}
162,"The Court has found that independence was lacking in investigations where, for example, the investigators:  were potential suspects (Bektaş and Özalp v. Turkey, 2010, § 66; Orhan v. Turkey, 2002, § 342);  were direct colleagues of the persons subject to investigation or likely to be so (Ramsahai and Others v. the Netherlands [GC], 2007, §§ 335-341; Emars v. Latvia, 2014, §§ 85 and 95);  were in a hierarchical relationship with the potential suspects (Şandru and Others v. Romania, 2009, § 74; Enukidze and Girgvliani v. Georgia, 2011, §§ 247 et seq.).",guide_art_2_eng,163,{}
163,"In some cases the Court has interpreted the specific action of the investigative bodies as an indication of a lack of independence, such as,  the failure to carry out certain measures which would elucidate the circumstances of the case (Sergey Shevchenko v. Ukraine, 2006, §§ 72-73);  the excessive weight given to the suspects statements (Kaya v. Turkey, 1998, § 89);  the failure to explore certain obvious and necessary lines of inquiry (Oğur v. Turkey [GC], 1999, §§ 90-91); inertia (Rupa v. Romania (no. 1), 2008, §§ 123-124). ",guide_art_2_eng,164,{}
164,"The Court did not find an issue regarding the independence of the investigation in the following circumstances:  the mere fact that the investigators and the investigated were sharing living quarters in the particular context of military operations conducted abroad (Jaloud v. the Netherlands [GC], 2014, § 189);  where the military court which carried out the review of the investigation failed to enjoy full statutory independence but there was absence of direct hierarchical, institutional or other ties between it and the main potential suspect and the specific conduct of that court did not reflect a lack of independence or impartiality in the handling of the investigation (Mustafa Tunç and Fecire Tunç v. Turkey [GC], 2015, § 254).",guide_art_2_eng,165,{}
165,"In order to be “effective” as this expression is to be understood in the context of Article 2 of the Convention, an investigation into a death that engages the responsibility of the Contracting Party under that Article must firstly be adequate (Ramsahai and Others v. the Netherlands [GC], 2007, § 324). That means that, it must be capable of leading to a determination of whether the force used was or was not justified in the circumstances and of identifying and – if appropriate – punishing those responsible (Armani Da Silva v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2016, § 243). This is not an obligation of result, but of means (Tahsin Acar v. Turkey [GC], 2004, § 223; Jaloud v. the Netherlands [GC], 2014, § 186).",guide_art_2_eng,166,{}
166,"The authorities must take whatever reasonable steps they can to secure the evidence concerning the incident, including, inter alia, eyewitness testimony, forensic evidence and where appropriate, an autopsy which provides a complete and accurate record of injury and an objective analysis of the clinical findings, including the cause of death. (Armani Da Silva v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2016, § 233). In this connection, the Court has held that an effective investigation may, in some circumstances, require the exhumation of the bodies of the deceased, despite the family’s opposition (Solska and Rybicka v. Poland, 2018, §§ 120-121). Moreover, where there has been a use of force by State agents, the investigation must also be effective in the sense that it is capable of leading to a determination of whether the force used was or was not justified (Armani Da Silva v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2016, § 233). Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of death or the person or persons responsible will risk failing foul of this standard (Al-Skeini and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2011, § 166).",guide_art_2_eng,167,{}
167,"In particular, the investigation’s conclusions must be based on a thorough, objective and impartial analysis of all relevant elements. Failing to follow an obvious line of inquiry undermines to a decisive extent the investigation’s ability to establish the circumstances of the case and the identity of those responsible (Mustafa Tunç and Fecire Tunç v. Turkey [GC], 2015, § 175).",guide_art_2_eng,168,{}
168,"The Court has found the investigation inadequate when, for example:  the investigation into a fatal shooting by the police during an attempted arrest had been undermined by shortcomings such as the failure to test the hands of officers in question for gunshot residue; to stage a reconstruction of the incident; to examine their weapons or ammunition; the lack of an adequate pictorial record of the trauma caused to the victim’s body by the fatal bullet; and the failure to separate the officers involved in the incident before their questioning (Ramsahai and Others v. the Netherlands [GC], 2007, §§ 326-332);  the forensic investigation was defective (Tanlı v. Turkey, 2001, § 153);  the authorities accepted the version of facts presented by the accused State agents without hearing any further witnesses (Özalp and Others v. Turkey, 2004, § 45) or placed heavy reliance on the report prepared by them (İkincisoy v. Turkey, 2004, § 78);  no investigation had been conducted into the flight log which constituted a key element in the possible identification and prosecution of those responsible for the bombing of civilian villages by military aircraft (Benzer and Others v. Turkey, 2013, § 196);  the investigation into the contract killing of an investigative journalist focused only on a single line of inquiry without exploring other allegations (Mazepa and Others v. Russia, 2018, §§ 77-79).",guide_art_2_eng,169,{}
169,"By contrast, having regard to the various steps undertaken by the domestic authorities, the Court did not find an issue with respect to the adequacy of the investigation in:  Mustafa Tunç and Fecire Tunç v.

171,"The Court accepts that there may be obstacles or difficulties which prevent progress in an investigation in a particular situation, but it considers that a prompt response by the authorities in investigating a use of lethal force, may generally be regarded as essential in maintaining public confidence in their adherence to the rule of law and in preventing any appearance of collusion in or tolerance of unlawful acts (Al-Skeini and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], 2011, § 167; Tahsin Acar v.

173,"The Court has found that the domestic authorities have, inter alia, failed to investigate with sufficient promptness and reasonable expedition in the following cases:  Kelly and Others v. the United Kingdom, 2001, § 136: the inquest proceedings into the killing of the applicants’ relatives by the security forces in an operation commenced eight years after the deaths;  Nafiye Çetin and Others v.

This requirement does not, however, go so far as to require all aspects of all proceedings following an inquiry into a violent death to be public as disclosure or for example, publication of police reports and investigative materials may involve sensitive issues with possible prejudicial effects on private individuals or other investigations and, therefore, cannot be regarded as an automatic requirement under Article 2 of the Convention. The degree of public scrutiny required may vary from case to case (Ramsahai and Others v. the Netherlands [GC], 2007, § 353; Giuliani and Gaggio v. Italy [GC], 2011, § 304).",guide_art_2_eng,176,{}

To date, the Court has not faulted a prosecutorial decision which flowed from an investigation which was in all other respects Article 2 compliant nor required the competent domestic court to order a prosecution if that court had taken the considered view that application of the appropriate criminal legislation to the known facts would not result in a conviction (Hanan v.
