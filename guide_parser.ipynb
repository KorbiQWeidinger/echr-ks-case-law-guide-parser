      "1.   Since its first ever judgment Lawless v. Ireland (no. 1), 1960, the European Court of Human Rights \n",
      "(“the Court”) has had occasion to adjudicate a large number of cases concerning terrorism. \n",
      "\n",
      "2.  The  present  text  summarises  this  case-law,  describing  the  stages  in  any  antiterrorist  operation, \n",
      "from the surveillance phase, through arrest, to the punitive phase. \n",
      "\n",
      "I.  Surveillance by security services \n",
      "\n",
      "Article 8 of the Convention \n",
      "\n",
      "“1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is \n",
      "in  accordance  with  the  law  and  is  necessary  in  a  democratic  society  in  the  interests  of  national \n",
      "security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or \n",
      "crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of \n",
      "others.” \n",
      "\n",
      "3.  Having regard to the structure of this provision, an applicant complaining of a violation of Article 8 \n",
      "must first of all demonstrate that his complaint belongs to the category of interests protected by the \n",
      "right to respect for his private and family life, his home and/or his correspondence. Where surveillance \n",
      "measures are concerned, that is not difficult. In principle, although Article 8 is not unlimited in scope, \n",
      "the Court defines its scope and application fairly broadly (Uzun v. Germany, 2010, § 43). \n",
      "\n",
      "4.  Having established that a surveillance measure falls within the scope of Article 8, the Court must \n",
      "then consider whether the impugned measure(s) led to an interference in the person’s exercise of the \n",
      "right secured under Article 8 or if they were taken in accordance with the Contracting State’s positive \n",
      "obligations.  Indeed,  the  second  paragraph  of  Article  8  sets  out  the  conditions  under  which  the \n",
      "authorities  can  interfere  in  the  exercise  of  the  right  protected;  such  interference  must  pursue  a \n",
      "legitimate aim and be “in accordance with the law” and “necessary in a democratic society”. \n",
      "\n",
      "A.  Establishing the interference \n",
      "\n",
      "5.  With the expansion of new technology, surveillance measures have taken on a variety of forms. \n",
      "Such  measures  are  almost  invariably  considered  by  the  Court  as  interferences,  albeit  with  varying \n",
      "degrees  of  gravity,  with  the  right  to  respect  for  the  private  life,  home  or  correspondence  of  the \n",
      "individuals concerned. \n",
      "\n",
      "6.  In that context, interception of communications (Amann v. Switzerland [GC], 2000, and Kennedy \n",
      "v. the United Kingdom, 2010) restrictions on the secrecy of mail, post and telecommunications (Klass \n",
      "and  Others  v. Germany,  1978),  surveillance  of  telephone  calls  from  professional  premises  (Halford \n",
      "v. the  United  Kingdom,  1997),  email  correspondence  and  Internet  usage  (Copland  v. the  United \n",
      "Kingdom, 2007)  surveillance of the use of online chat services (Bărbulescu  v. Romania  [GC], 2017), \n",
      "police bugging of private premises (Allan v. the United Kingdom, 2022), in the framework of a criminal \n",
      "investigation (Vetter  v. France),  2005, sound equipment installed in prisons (Wisse  v. France, 2005, \n",
      "use of a listening device installed on an individual’s body (Heglas v. Czech Republic, 2007), filming of \n",
      "an applicant at a police station and broadcasting of the footage on television (Khmel v. Russia, 2013), \n",
      "GPS surveillance (Uzun v. Germany, 2010), retention of fingerprints and DNA profiles (S. and Marper \n",

      "examples  of  interference  by  the  authorities  in  the  applicant’s  exercise  of  the  right  secured  under \n",
      "Article 8 of the Convention. \n",
      "\n",
      "7.  As  regards  secret  surveillance  measures,  in  Klass  and  Others  v. Germany,  1978,  where  the \n",
      "applicants (lawyers and judges) challenged the compatibility with the Convention of a law laying down \n",
      "restrictions on the secrecy of correspondence, mail and telecommunications, the Court agreed that \n",
      "under certain conditions an individual could claim to be a victim of a violation occasioned by the mere \n",
      "existence of secret measures or of legislation permitting secret measures, without having to allege \n",
      "that the measures were actually applied to him. In other words, according to the principles set out in \n",
      "this judgment, the mere risk is sufficient to claim victimhood within the meaning of the Convention. \n",
      "\n",
      "8.  In the case of Kennedy v. the United Kingdom, 2010, the Court further developed this approach by \n",
      "ruling  that  regard  should  be  had  to  the  special  reasons  justifying  the  Court’s  departure,  in  cases \n",
      "concerning secret measures, from its general approach denying individuals the right to challenge a \n",
      "law in abstracto. In order to assess whether an individual could claim an interference as a result of the \n",
      "mere existence of legislation permitting secret surveillance measures, the Court had to consider the \n",
      "availability of any remedies at the national level and the risk of secret surveillance measures being \n",
      "applied to him. It held that where there was no possibility of challenging the alleged application of \n",
      "secret surveillance measures at domestic level, widespread suspicion and concern among the general \n",
      "public that secret surveillance powers were being abused could not be said to be unjustified. In such \n",
      "cases, even where the actual risk of surveillance was low, there was a greater need for scrutiny by the \n",
      "Court (Kennedy v. the United Kingdom, 2010, § 124). \n",
      "\n",
      "9.  In the case of Roman Zakharov v. Russia [GC], 2015, the Court found that the approach set out in \n",
      "Kennedy afforded it the requisite degree of flexibility to deal with a variety of situations which might \n",
      "arise in the context of secret surveillance, taking into account the particularities of the legal systems \n",
      "in the member States, namely the available remedies, as well as the different personal situations of \n",
      "applicants (Roman Zakharov v. Russia [GC], 2015, § 172). Thus an applicant could still claim to be a \n",
      "victim of a violation of the Convention if he or she fell within the scope of the legislation authorising \n",
      "the secret surveillance measures (because he or she belonged to a group of persons covered by that \n",
      "legislation or the latter applied to everyone) and had no remedy to contest such covert surveillance. \n",
      "Furthermore,  even  if  remedies  existed,  an  applicant  could  still  claim  to  be  a  victim  of  the  mere \n",
      "existence of secret measures or legislation permitting such measures if he or she could show that, due \n",
      "to his or her personal situation, he or she was potentially at risk of being subjected to such measures. \n",
      "\n",
      "B.  Is the interference in accordance with the law? \n",
      "\n",
      "10.  It  transpires  from  the  Court’s  case-law  that  any  interference  with  the  exercise  of  the  right  to \n",
      "respect for the rights protected by Article 8 must be “in accordance with the law”. For further details, \n",
      "see the Case-Law Guide on Article 81. \n",
      "\n",
      "C.  Does the interference pursue a legitimate aim?  \n",
      "\n",
      "11.  Article 8 § 2 lists the legitimate aims capable of justifying interference with the exercise of the \n",
      "right to respect for private and family life: it must be “necessary for national security, public safety, \n",
      "the economic well-being of the country, the prevention of crime, the protection of health or morals, \n",
      "or  for  the  protection  of  the  rights  and  freedoms  of  others”.  In  the  fight  against  terrorism,  such \n",
      "interference  is  considered  by  the  Court  as  pursuing  a  legitimate  aim  within  the  meaning  of  this \n",
      "provision  because  it  is  covered  by  considerations  of  national  security,  prevention  of  disorder  and \n",
      "protection of the rights and freedoms of others (see, inter alia, Klass and Others v. Germany, 1978). \n",

      "administered  the  force  but  also  all  the  surrounding  circumstances,  including  such  matters  as  the \n",
      "planning  and  control  of  the  actions  under  examination.  The  Court  had,  in  particular,  to  consider \n",

      "negligent in their choice of action (see, mutatis mutandis, Ayvazyan v. Armenia, § 93). It also considers \n",
      "whether, at the material time, a balance had been struck between the aim pursued by the authorities \n",
      "and  the  means  used  to  that  end.  In  the  case  of  Güleç  v. Turkey,  which  concerned  allegations  of \n",
      "unlawful  homicide  by  the  security  forces  during  a  non-peaceful  demonstration  and  the  failure  to \n",
      "conduct an appropriate investigation into the circumstances of the death, the Court accepted that the \n",
      "use of force might have been justified. It pointed out, however, that in the circumstances of the case \n",

      "such  as  to  interfere  significantly  with  their  visiting  rights.  The  Court  had  accepted  that  the  fact  of \n",
      "detaining a person in a prison so far from his family that it was very difficult, indeed impossible, for \n",
      "them to visit him could, under certain circumstances, amount to an interference with the prisoner’s \n",
